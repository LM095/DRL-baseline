# DRL-baseline



### Requirements:

**Tensorflow**: [![PyPI](https://badge.fury.io/py/tensorflow.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/tensorflow)  

**OpenAI Gym**: [![Gym](https://badge.fury.io/py/gym.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/gym)


This repo contains a personal implementation of different value-based and policy-gradient Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods. 
The implemented algorithms are separated into two different folders: 

- **Value-based** methods:
  - [x] DQN [1]
  - [x] DDQN [2]
  - [ ] Dueling DQN [3] 

- **Policy-gradient** methods:
  - [x] REINFORCE [4]
  - [ ] DDPG [5]
  - [ ] PPO Monte Carlo (PPO_MC) [6]
  - [ ] PPO Temporal Difference (PPO_TD) [6]
  - [ ] Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) [7]
  - [ ] Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) [8]

All the methods in every subfolder rely on a single algorithm written in Tensorflow2 and Keras. The code is commented in detail to facilitate understanding and replicability in other frameworks such as PyTorch.



### Results

According to the chosen methods, each algorithm was tested on different runs with random seeds over 1000 episodes on two different OpenAI gym environments (continuous and/or discrete cases). The plot shows the average reward of the last 100 episodes and the number of episodes for each method.
